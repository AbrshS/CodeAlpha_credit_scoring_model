# Credit Scoring Model

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for credit risk assessment using machine learning techniques. It includes a Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction, along with pre-trained models for immediate use.

## Project Structure

- **credit_scoring_model.ipynb**  
  The main notebook containing all steps for data analysis, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

- **models/**  
  Directory containing serialized machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and a data scaler for reproducibility and deployment.

- **Data/**  
  Folder for storing datasets used in model development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `credit_scoring_model.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Follow the notebook instructions to explore the data, retrain models, or use the pre-trained models for prediction.

## Requirements

- Python (version as per your environment)
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn
- xgboost
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

(Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` if a requirements file is provided.)
